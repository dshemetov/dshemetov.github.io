It&amp;rsquo;s here on Bandcamp.
I am quite proud of it. Not so much of the guitar playing or the composition, but of the fact that I actually put something out. I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing guitar for almost 20 years and finishing and publishing projects has been my biggest challenge1.
So here&amp;rsquo;s to overcoming long-held hurdles.
My two main projects were a cover of Sikth &amp;ldquo;Bland Street Bloom&amp;rdquo; in 2011 and a metal radio show called HEAVY from 2015-2016, which I co-hosted with my friend George Mossessian.</description></item></channel></rss>
