I earned a PhD in Applied Mathematics from University of California, Davis in 2021, advised by James Sharpnack.
My Google Scholar has my publications.
My PhD work studied statistical problems on graphs.
Specifically, I was interested in

information theory and statistics with memory constraints,
networks and graph algorithms,
combinatorics, probability, and Markov Chains.

Timeline

Mar, 2021 Finished my dissertation titled &ldquo;Concerning Some Statistical Problems on Graphs&rdquo; and received my doctorate.
Aug, 2020 Began work at Delphi, helping build COVID forecasting models and engineering epidata pipelines.
Oct, 2019 Attended GeoVet 2019. James presented our work on scan statistics epidemiology.
Aug, 2019 Presented a poster at KDD2019 in Anchorage, Alaska.
Summer, 2019 Started a project to apply scan statistics to epidemiology with Beatriz Lopez and James Sharpnack.
Mar, 2019 Our paper “Estimating Graphlet Statistics via Lifting” was accepted for a poster presentation at KDD2019! Big thanks to Kiril Paramonov for the conceptual work and to James for including me on the project.
2018-2019 Organized the reading group “Information Theory and Statistics”.
Jul, 2018 Gave a talk on “Statistical Limits in Hierarchical Communication” in the Student Chapter Presentations section at the 2018 SIAM Annual Meeting in Portland, Oregon.
Jun, 2018 Passed my qualifying exam with a proposal titled “Towards Statistical Limits in Hierarchical Communication”.
Summer, 2017 Participated in the Machine Learning Summer Program at Los Alamos National Lab. I studied parameter learning in models of power transmission with Marc Vuffray and Andrey Lokhov. Our paper was accepted to PSCC2018: “Online Learning of Power Transmission Dynamics”.
Jan, 2017 Co-organized the Davis Math Conference, a conference for professors and students to communicate their research in the Davis Math department.
2014-2016 Studied the inference of stochastic processes with memory, using Hidden Markov Models, information theory, and computational mechanics with Jim Crutchfield.
