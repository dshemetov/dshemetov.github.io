# Academic History

{{< figure src="/images/math-dmitry.jpg" height="300px" width="300px" >}}

I earned a PhD in Applied Mathematics from University of California, Davis in 2021, advised by [James Sharpnack](https://jsharpna.github.io/).
My [Google Scholar has my publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1XIVRXMAAAAJ).

My PhD work studied statistical problems on graphs.
Specifically, I was interested in

- information theory and statistics with memory constraints,
- networks and graph algorithms,
- combinatorics, probability, and Markov Chains.
