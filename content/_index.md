# Hi!

{{< figure src="/images/canyon-dmitry.jpg" height="300px" width="300px" caption="With a pretty big canyon." >}}

I am statistical systems engineer living in the California Bay Area.
My educational background is in applied mathematics.
I love getting nerd sniped by math, systems engineering, and other such topics.

I am a musician (guitar, mandolin, DIY synths), a Zen meditator, and a gamer (Doom and Factorio).
I am happy to live in a group house with my friends and 2 cats.

By age 10, I had lived in these places, in order: Kyiv (Ukraine), Karaganda (Kazakhstan), Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk (Russia), Moscow (Russia), Tampa (USA).
I moved to California in my early 20s for graduate school.

The most browser tabs I've had open was 352.

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/dshemetov).
