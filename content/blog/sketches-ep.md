I made an album of improvised acoustic guitar songs this February.
It's here on [Bandcamp](https://flyingskeletonhand.bandcamp.com/album/sketches).

I am quite proud of it.
Not so much of the guitar playing or the composition, but of the fact that I actually put something out.
I've been playing guitar for almost 20 years and finishing and publishing projects has been my biggest challenge[^1].

So here's to overcoming long-held hurdles.

[^1]: My two main projects were a cover of [Sikth "Bland Street Bloom"](https://youtu.be/jtcjUgCWa8U) in 2011 and a metal radio show called [HEAVY](https://kdrt.org/program/heavy) from 2015-2016, which I co-hosted with my friend George Mossessian.
